## Configuration

### Thresholds

The tool uses a configuration file, `thresholds.yaml`, to define threshold values for generating warnings and suggestions. These thresholds can be customized to suit your specific environment.

#### Example `thresholds.yaml`:

```yaml
cpu_usage_threshold: 75  # CPU usage threshold in percentage
memory_usage_threshold: 80  # Memory usage threshold in percentage
latency_threshold_ms: 100  # Service latency threshold in milliseconds
pod_scheduling_delay_threshold: 300  # Pod scheduling delay threshold in seconds
disk_pressure_threshold: 90  # Disk usage threshold in percentage
```

### Customizing Thresholds

To customize the thresholds, simply edit the `thresholds.yaml` file in the project directory. For example, to increase the CPU usage threshold to 85%, change the `cpu_usage_threshold` value:

```yaml
cpu_usage_threshold: 85
```

## Important Notes

- **Permissions:** Ensure the user or service account running the tool has sufficient permissions to access Kubernetes API resources like nodes, pods, services, deployments, etc.
- **Resource Consumption:** Running full diagnostics on large clusters may take time and consume resources; consider scheduling it during low-traffic periods.
- **Security Considerations:** Ensure that the tool is run in a secure environment, especially when dealing with sensitive data like kubeconfig files or API tokens. Regularly update the tool and its dependencies to address any potential security vulnerabilities.
